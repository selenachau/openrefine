The speech starts with someone telling a personal story about how they became familiar with Ross Gelbspan's writings. Gelbspan begins by talking about how the global economy can become stagnant and how the more reliable path to getting out of it would be global works programs. Which he says will lift off the economy within a decade. He then turns to talking about planet heating and how it is getting hotter and hotter. He wants to replace everything that hurts the climate with climate emission responsible products, including heaters and cars. He continues to speak about temperature change and how it effects the globe and how it can affect the economy in the decades to come. Says that some politicians tried to use science to convince older and less educated people that climate change was not true. Says that outside of the U.S. there is little to no debate on climate change. He talks about the U.S. pulled out of Kyoto Accord when Bush took office because they did not see it as fair to first world countries. His dad originally signed the agreement. Believes the time is right to try and reduce climate change, says we have all the allies we need but the time to act is rapidly decreasing and we need to act fast. Gelbspan's talk end with a Q&A, which is very quiet on the Q end.",,2004-10-05,unknown,Minidisc,KBOO Archives Room,01:03:27,,unknown,KBOO,,64A6A885401F29C3B5BE6AED0A62A9B5,kboo_MD-156_20041005.wav,,641 MB,"Nice, clean sound.

Thinks we as a country need to change the way people are taught, he wants to show them and not just yell at them. Talks about mad cow disease and its origins. Talks about how he was being sued along with Oprah for food disparagement. But the FDA banned the practice the were being sued for.

Including Kangaroo care and how the hospital referred to them as miracle babies. Then starts speaking about how food gives you the energy to do what you love and how in every culture eating with others can lead to peace-making. Other topics include meat based diets, how bad the living conditions of animals are, how people should protect animal rights, weather disturbances/ climate change and how it affects how food is produced. People need to switch to a plant-based diet. He later talks about Monsanto and how we as people are not yet evolved enough to eat genetically modified food and how they should be labeled.

17343,D-108,Challenging Corporate Power,Corporations,"Program #GROR003. Recorded in Provincetown, MA on August 23, 1998. Once corporations got a foot in the door to power in the late 1890s, it took less than a century to buy the whole building and the ground it stands on. Corporate dominance of the public sphere and its growing presence in our private lives are increasingly viewed as simply the way things are--it's just business. When corporate power is challenged by public advocates and small grassroots efforts, they often find themselves up against the goliathan might of money and big media. In this interview, Grossman provides a historical context for legal and civil disobedient resistance to corporate power and discusses late-1990s efforts to defend the commonweal.
